/**
 * \page PAGE_BOA_LOGGING BOA - Logging
 *
 * BOA contains a logger component, which allows other BOA components to write log entries to a log destination. The log destination
 * can be supplied by a BOA client, allowing BOA log entries to be added to the client's log, or BOA can use its own default log
 * destination.
 *
 * The default BOA log destination is enabled by creating the file "<BOA installation dir>\Config\log_config.txt". This file is expected
 * to have lines of the form "key = value". The following keys are supported:
 *  - @b logFileDir:        the path to the directory in which the default log destination will create the log file. The log file
 *                          itself will be named "boa_<process name>.log".
 *  - @b categoryFilter:    the value of the category filter used by the default log destination (see Log_SetCategoryFilter()).
 *  - @b maxLogFileSize:    the maximum permitted log file size. Once the log file reaches this size, it will be renamed to
 *                          "boa_<process name>.log.archived" (any previously archived file will be deleted) and a new log file will
 *                          be opened.
 *  - @b logFileFlushLevel: the stream to the log file will be flushed after every <logFileFlushLevel> entries are written.
 *                          If this is zero, the stream will never be explicitly flushed.
 *
 * If a configuration file of this form can be read and parsed successfully, the default log destination will write log entries as
 * specified by the configuration file. If the configuration file is not present or cannot be parsed, the default log destination
 * will not operate.
 *
 * The log file written by the default log destination is XML, with each log entry taking this form:
 * @code
 *     <entry
 *          t="time (in nanoseconds since 1/1/1970)"
 *          pro="process name"
 *          mod="module name"
 *          stk="call stack ID (unused)"
 *          thd="thread ID"
 *          loc="filename, function name and line number"
 *          cat="category"><![CDATA[log message]]></entry>
 * @endcode
 * (line breaks inserted for readability)
 *
 * The supported categories are described by the enum @ref Log_Category.
 *
 * If a BOA client does not want to use the default log destination, the client can configure a custom log destination by supplying
 * a callback function pointer to either Log_SetDestinationEx() or Log_SetDestination(). Once this is done, the BOA logger will send
 * all future log entries to the client's callback, instead of to the default log destination. A BOA client can also use the function
 * Log_SetCategoryFilter() to control which categories of log entry are sent to the callback.

* This way any other project whose source files include this file see BOALOGGING_API functions as being imported from a DLL,
* whereas dll-logging sees symbols defined with this macro as being exported.
