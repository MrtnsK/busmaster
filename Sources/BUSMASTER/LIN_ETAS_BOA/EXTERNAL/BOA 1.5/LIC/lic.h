      @defgroup GROUP_BOA_LIC Licence Interface (LIC)
      @brief    The LIC API provides licence information obtained from a connected hardware controller.

      @details
      The LIC API can be used in two use cases:

      -# An instance of an ETAS relabelled hardware device usually contains some device-specific licence information in
         its firmware which determines whether the device instance is permitted to operate with an ETAS software tool.
         This licence information is sometimes referred to as an "ETAS bit" in the device's firmware.
         An ETAS software tool can use the API LIC_GetLicenceValue() to obtain this information and decide whether to
         allow the user to access the device instance.

      -# When a non-ETAS (i.e. 3rd-party) software tool is using BOA to access ETAS hardware, the 3rd-party tool may
         require ETAS hardware to act as a dongle for the tool. In order to support this, an ETAS hardware device must be
         able to encapsulate information about the licencing of various features of the 3rd-party tool. This can be achieved
         by allowing an ETAS hardware device to encapsulate an arbitrary blob of data, which is stored on the device by the
         3rd-party and later queried by the 3rd-party's software tool.

      <H2>Use case 1</H2>
      An instance of an ETAS relabelled hardware device usually contains some device-specific licence information in
      its firmware which determines whether the device instance is permitted to operate with an ETAS software tool.
      This licence information is sometimes referred to as an "ETAS bit" in the device's firmware.
      An ETAS software tool can use the API LIC_GetLicenceValue() to obtain this information and decide whether to
      allow the user to access the device instance.

      An ETAS software tool uses LIC_GetLicenceValue() to obtain licence information from an ETAS relabelled device as
      follows:
        -# The ETAS software tool uses @ref CSI_GetOcdAuthInfo() to authenticate the device's OCD DLL. This allows the
           ETAS software tool to trust any information which it subsequently obtained from the device's OCD DLL.
        -# The ETAS software tool calls LIC_GetLicenceValue(). This function accepts an identifier, identifying the required
           licence value, and returns a string containing the licence value. @ref LIC_LicenceValueId describes the licence
           values which are defined.
        -# The implementation of LIC_GetLicenceValue() within the device's OCD examines the device's firmware and calculates
           the licence value requested by the ETAS software tool, if necessary converting the raw information stored in
           device's firmware into a string which can be understood by the ETAS software tool.
        -# The ETAS software tool enables or disables the hardware device according to the licence value received.

      Note that although this mechanism is intended to allow an ETAS-relabelled device to expose licence information,
      ETAS's own devices must participate in this mechanism too, i.e. they must also implement LIC_GetLicenceValue().

      <H2>Use case 2</H2>
      When a non-ETAS (i.e. 3rd-party) software tool is using BOA to access ETAS hardware, the 3rd-party tool may require
      ETAS hardware to act as a dongle for the tool. In order to support this, an ETAS hardware device must be able to
      encapsulate information about the licencing of various features of the 3rd-party tool. This can be achieved by allowing
      an ETAS hardware device to encapsulate an arbitrary blob of data, which is stored on the device by the 3rd-party and
      later queried by the 3rd-party's software tool.

      The following is the sequence which is used by a 3rd-party to store licence information in an ETAS device which supports
      the LIC API, thereby turning the ETAS device into a dongle. It is expected that the 3rd-party will create a tool to
      perform this:
        -# The 3rd-party prepares a blob of licence data, which is private to the 3rd-party.
        -# The 3rd-party obtains a string containing device-specific identity information for the dongle device. On one device,
           this may be a MAC address; on another device this may be a serial number, etc. The value of this string for any
           given device can be obtained by calling the function LIC_GetDeviceId(). The value outputted by this function will
           be constant for any given device instance.
        -# To initialise an ETAS device as a dongle, the 3rd-party calls the function LIC_SetLicenceBlob(). This accepts:
            - the 3rd-party's licence blob;
            - a signature, calculated using a key which is private to the 3rd-party, over the licence blob and the
              device-specific identity string obtained via LIC_GetDeviceId(). The 3rd-party may omit this signature if he does
              not care about preventing an attacker from copying the licence blob from one device instance to another.

      This is the sequence which is followed at runtime by the 3rd-party's software tool to use the licence information
      contained in the ETAS dongle device:
        -# The 3rd-party software tool uses @ref CSI_GetOcdAuthInfo() to authenticate the ETAS device's OCD DLL. This allows the
           3rd-party software tool to trust any information which it subsequently obtains from the ETAS device.
        -# The 3rd-party software tool calls the BOA function LIC_GetLicenceBlob(). This function returns the information which
           was stored by LIC_SetLicenceBlob(), i.e.:
            - the licence blob;
            - a signature, calculated using a key which is private to the 3rd-party, over the licence blob and the
              device-specific identity string obtained via LIC_GetDeviceId().
        -# The 3rd-party software calls the BOA function LIC_GetDeviceId() to obtain the device's identity string.
        -# The 3rd-party software uses the 3rd-party's public key to check that the signature returned by LIC_GetLicenceBlob()
           is correct. This confirms that:
            - the licence blob has not been modified;
            - the licence blob has not been copied to a different device.
        -# Finally, the 3rd-party measurement tool enables or disables its various features according to the contents of the
           licence blob.

      @param[in]  lenBlob           The number of bytes at @p pBlob.
      @param[in]  lenBlobSig        The number of bytes at @p pBlobSig.
      @param[out] pMaxLenBlob       The maximum permitted length of the licence blob, measured in bytes. This may be NULL if the
                                    caller does not need this information.
      @param[out] pMaxLenBlobSig    The maximum permitted length of the licence blob signature, measured in bytes. This may be
                                    NULL if the caller does not need this information.

      This function is used to retrieve a blob of licence information in the firmware of the device  which is associated with a

      @param[in]  lenBlobBuf    The number of bytes at @p pBlobBuf.
      @param[in]  lenBlobSigBuf The number of bytes at @p pBlobSigBuf.
