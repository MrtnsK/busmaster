    /**
      Create a FlexRay transmit queue.

      A transmit queue is required to send FlexRay frames.
      FlexRay controllers support multiple transmit queues. Any queue locks exclusive access to a single or multiple
      send buffer. When a queue accesses multiple send buffers the queued data must be multiplexed to all allocated
      buffers to use the provided bandwidth in an optimized fashion. Suppression effects in the dynamic segment may
      decrease the usable bandwidth, however.

      If multiple send buffers are accessed by the queue the driver has to dynamically multiplex the messages on these
      buffers to try to preserve the order of the messages on the bus interface. All messages written to a single queue
      will occur in-order on the bus interface if the configuration of the TX queue fulfils these constraints:
        - All buffers send in the same cycles, i.e. cyclePeriod and cycleOffset of
          @ref OCI_FlexRayTxBufferCoreConfiguration have identical values for all send buffers
        - All buffers send on the same channel(s), i.e. channel of @ref OCI_FlexRayTxBufferCoreConfiguration
          has identical values for all send buffers
        - All buffers have the same payload length, i.e. payloadLength of @ref OCI_FlexRayTxBufferConfiguration
          has identical values for all send buffers

      If the configuration of the TX queue does not meet the above constraints, the driver may nevertheless be able to
      ensure that messages in the queue appear in-order on the bus interface. However, the driver is not obliged to do so,
      and may instead return @ref OCI_WARN_NO_INORDER_TX from @ref OCI_CreateFlexRayTxQueue(), to indicate that messages
      added to the TX queue may appear out-of-order on the bus.

      Different queues are not synchronized by the API. Although data written to a single queue will occur in order
      on the bus interface, the data written to different queues may occur in a different order on the interface.
      The order depends on the filling level of the different queues and scheduling algorithm of the FlexRay Bus
      configuration.

      Queue FlexRay frames for transmission on a FlexRay-Bus.

      The function returns, when all frames can be placed in the transmit queue. Since the transmit queue has a limited
      capacity, this function may need to block until the last entry could be placed into the queue. A @ref timeout
      can be specified to limit the blocking.

      There is no information, when the frames are send on the FlexRay bus. There may be a delay between storing the
      frames in the queue and sending them, because of the scheduling of the FlexRay-Bus. Especially frames in the
      dynamic segment may be stalled until the slot is scheduled. A fatal error on the FlexRay-Bus may occur
      before the controller was able to send the data.

      If an error occurs before all frames could be placed into the controller transmit queue, this function will
      return immediately with an error code. It will not try to push the remaining messages into the queue. Frames
      that are already queued, will not be removed.

      The frames of a single queue will occur in order on the FlexRay-Bus. Transmission of frames from other queues
      are not synchronized to the queue.

                            The timeout uses the same resolution as the controller timestamp. The resolution may vary
                            between different driver for different hardware. The interval may be increased to the time

      In the default configuration of a receive queue no data will be received because any data is blocked by
      some filter condition. The application must enable the recpetion of the data by setting white filter
      (defining pass conditions).

      This function allows the reception of specific FlexRay frames identified by (masked) Frame ID, channel and
      cycle. The frames may be queued and read by OCI_ReadFlexRayData() or a callback is triggered whenever a
      frame passes the filter. The signalization path to the application is defined by the creation of the
      receive queue. If OCI_CANRxQueueConfiguration::onFrame (see OCI_CreateFlexRayRxQueue) is not NULL the registered
      callback is executed. If If OCI_CANRxQueueConfiguration::onFrame is NULL the frame is queued and can be read
      by PCI_ReadFlexRayData().

      Filter conditions allow an effective reduction of the payload, that must be handled by the driver and
      application. The sequence of processing the filter array is undefined. When a frame matches to more than
      one filter the frame will be passed to the application, but the used filter tag (identifying the matching
      filter) is implementation specific and may change in different versions and on different hardware.
