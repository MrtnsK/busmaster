    /**
      Set the LIN controller properties (suspended / running) of the LIN controller instance.

      Properties are read/writeable and can be queried OCI_GetLINControllerProperties().

      These properties are the locigal state of this controller instance.
      @li In the @a SUSPENDED state the controller instance will neither send any data on the interface nor receive
          any data.
      @li In the @a RUNNING state the controller instance will send data, when the transmit queue is not empty and
          receive any data that passes a configured filter condition.

      In a hardware that supports multiple instances on a single physical interface the state of the physical controller
      will be @a RUNNING until the last instance suspends the logical state.

      The @a SUSPENDED state is useful to configure a set of filter and activate the complete new set with at the
      same time. When the filter are set by (especially a sequence of different) API-calls intermediate states
      exist where some filter already active and other not. This may be critical for specific applications.

      The @a properties parameter describes the controller state after successful execution of the command. When
      the controller is already in the desired state the driver will ignore the command and return @ref OCI_SUCCESS.

      @controllerState RUNNING, SUSPENDED. \n
                       A transition to the RUNNING or SUSPENDED state may be executed
                       (depends on the parameter @a properties).

      @param[in]  controller            Handle of the LIN controller interface instance for which the properties are set.

      @param[in]  controllerProperties  Pointer to the LIN controller properties that are set for the controller instance.
                                        Must not be @c NULL.
