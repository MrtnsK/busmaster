      Add white filter condition(s) to enable the reception of Queue events for a specific receive queue.

      In the default configuration of a receive queue no data will be received because any data is blocked by
      some filter condition. The application must enable the reception of the data by setting white filter
      (defining pass conditions).

      This function allows the reception of specific events of a Queue. In principle the events may be delivered
      in-band in the normal data stream or generate a (separate) callback. The signalization path to the application
      is defined by the creation of the receive queue. (See also OCI_CreateCANRxQueue(),
      OCI_CreateLINRxQueue(), OCI_CreateFlexRayRxQueue()).

      This function is useful to trigger a filling level based reading of a queue. In this case the queue should
      be initialized without callback routines for frame recption. The filling level should fire events and a callback
      calls OCI_ReadCANData(), OCI_ReadLINData() or OCI_ReadFlexRayData(), when the @a OCI_QUEUE_HIGH_WATERMARK event
      is identified. On a Bus with low traffic or on a queue with strict filter conditions waiting for a specific
      filling level may cause a high latency in data processing.
