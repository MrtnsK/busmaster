      @section ERROR_CLASS Different Classes of Errors.

      Any Function call of of the OCI returns an @ref OCI_ErrorCode. There are three different classes of error codes:

       - SUCCESS: The normal return code of a function call should be @ref OCI_SUCCESS. The requested service is
                  executed without an error and the application can continue operation.
                  Note: Many services use a queued characteristic and a successful return of the call does not
                  guarantee a successful completion of the action. e.g. A CAN Frame can successfully be queued for
                  sending, but may never be send, when frames from other bus-nodes with higher priority saturate the
                  bus.
       - WARNING: In very rare cases a warning may occur. The driver was not able to execute the request exact in
                  the requested way, but has adapted some setting. The adaptation is the best estimation for a
                  @em compatible setting. The application may react on a warning, but in most cases it can proceeed
                  in the normal operational way.
                  An example for a warning is the adaptation of the sample point in a CAN-Bus configuration. The
                  hardware may be limited to set the sample point to an accuracy of 5%, but was requested to set it
                  to 87%. In this case the driver will use 85% and return with a warning. The application may read
                  the used parameter (by OCI_GetCANConfiguration()) to identify the adaptation.
       - ERROR:   The service was not executed successfully. The application has to react on the error.
                  Note: The driver is not able to detect the severity of the error. The error indicates, that the
                  driver did not execute the requested service for some reason.

      The different error classes are indicated by the upper two bits in the error code.

      @section ERROR_TYPE The error type.

      There are several different groups of error sources. In many cases it will be possible to react on all errors
      of the same type in the same way.

      - Parameter vaildation of a call fails.
        The driver validates the parameter supplied by the application and detects a plausibilty problem. In normal
        cases this type of error is caused by an implementation problem in the application.

      - Semantical inconsistences.
        The validation of some pre-conditions, that are required for a specific API call failed. The driver can not
        execute the requested action.

      - (Hardware specific-) resource problems.
        The hardware run out of resources. The reason for these kind of errors may be different. If a hardware supports
        multiple clients and implements multiple BUS-interfaces it may share some resources for all application accessing
        any interface of the system. In this case the termination of a different application may return the required
        resources. Other reasons for this error may be a resource leak in the driver or application.

      - Communication problems to the interface hardware.
        Especially external hardware (connected via Ethernet, USB, CardBus, ExpressCard, ...) may be removed while it
        is accessed by the driver. The reliability of some interface and protocol in a rough environment may be limited.
        In both cases the communication to the interface hardware may be disturbed or even disabled.
        When the hardware is accessible again the state of the interface hardware may be undefined. In most cases a
        complete re-initialization is required.

      - Implementation (internal) errors in the driver
        After passing the paramter and semantic validation a driver will verify the consistence of internal data. This
        verification may fail and an error can be delivered to the application. These kind of errors should never occur.
        The vendor of the driver has to analyze and fix the problem.

    /**
      Remove white filter condition(s) to disable the reception of driver internal error events for a specific receive
      queue.

      In the default configuration of a receive queue no data will be received because any data is blocked by some
      filter condition. The application must enable the reception of the data by setting white filter (defining pass
      conditions).

      This function allows to withdraw one or more white filter conditions set by OCI_AddInternalErrorEventFilter().
      Each @ref OCI_InternalErrorEventFilter of the filter array must exact match to a previously added filter. The
      withdrawn filter will not pass the event(s) any longer and silently discard the events.

      @param[in]  queue    Handle of the receive queue to modify.
      @param[in]  filter   A pointer to an array of @a count entries of type @ref OCI_InternalErrorEventFilter.
      @param[in]  count    Number of entries in the @a filter array.
