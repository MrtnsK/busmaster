    @page VersionHandling Version Handling

    @section VersionInformation Version Information

    Any version consists of four independent parts:

    @li   majorVersion.
    - The major Version identifies the feature set of an Interface. This version is incremented
    when some incompatible changes in the @ref BOA_ServiceId are made. When a server offers a higher
    major version than the client can access, an error is generated. A server may offer several
    different major versions at the same time.

    @li   minorVersion.
    - The minor Version identifies compatible extensions of an Interface. When a server offers additional
    features, but can still serve an older client, this number is increased.

    @li   bugfix.
    - The bugfix identifies corrections made in the implementation of the interface. The bugfix is
    implementation specific and therefore it may have different values for different implementations of
    the same feature set. The bugfix must not be used for any version check, but can only be used for
    informational and debugging purposes on a specific hardware.

    @li   build.
    - The build revision allows the verification of a specific version during the development phase.

    @section VersionNegotiation Version negotiation

    During the binding of a protocol a negotiation of the versions of a service are done. The client requests a
    version and the server delivers a version. In general the negotiation is done in three steps:

    -# The client selects the major and minor version it wants to use. This version is transmitted as requested
    version to the server.
    -# The server receives the request and offers a proposed version. The major version of the proposed version
    must be identical to the the major version of the requested version. When the server does not offer
    the requested major version it generates an error. The minor version may be not equal to the requested
    version. A higher minor version than the requested version identifies an server with additional feature.
    The client can ignore this information. A lower version than the requested version identifies an older
    interface. The client may not be able to use any service that is offered in the requested version.
    -# The client verifies the offered version. When the offered minor version is lower than the requested minor
    version the client may adapt itself to the limited feature set of the older interface and continue operation
    or may stop the binding process and exit with an error.
