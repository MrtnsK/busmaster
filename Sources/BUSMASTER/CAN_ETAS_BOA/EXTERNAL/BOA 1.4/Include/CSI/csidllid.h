    * @brief      Common declaration of a service required to find all BOA-APIs implemented
                  in a DLL for a specific parent node.
    @details

     This service is required for any DLL that implements some sub-service (node or protocol) of the root node.
     This service may be used by any different parent, when the childeren of the parent are implemented in
     different DLLs, too. In this case a UUID for the parent node has to be defined. The following figure
     illustrates the component view and the relation of the different APIs of the Connection Service Interface.

     Find all sub-items of the accessed DLL for a specific parent. This mechanism allows the
     extension of the supported sub-services (nodes and protocols) by the installation of additional

     any different DLL when the application browses inside of the sub-tree.
