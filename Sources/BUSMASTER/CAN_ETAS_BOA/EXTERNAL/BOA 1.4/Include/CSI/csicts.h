                  to a protocol stack, load the driver for a specific API and support
                  the binding of the static library part to the dynamically found and
                  loaded parts of the API.

    /** Deliver a handle which offers an interface compatible to the
        requested interfaceId and accessing a location defined in uriLocation.
        This hModule-Instance can be used by a (statically linked library) to
        map the APIinterface routines to the (dynamically loaded) implementation
        of the interface. The static linked library part will map additionally
        handles, which are created by the dynamically loaded part and which may
        be not unique within the API, when different modules are loaded and more
        instances are active.

                               references the location and name of the requested service.
        @param[in] interfaceId A uuid and required version of the API and the required
