 *                              be reference-counted by the caller, using the object's methods AddRef() and Release(). This is
 *                              easily done by wrapping the object pointer in an instance of the AutoPtr class, which will be done
 *                              automatically if the caller accesses IFlexRayLink_Create() via the wrapper IFlexRayLink::Create().
