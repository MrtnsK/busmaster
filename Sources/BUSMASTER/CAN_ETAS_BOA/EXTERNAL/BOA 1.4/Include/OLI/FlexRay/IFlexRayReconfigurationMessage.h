/**
* @ingroup GROUP_OLI_FLEXRAY_MESSAGES
* @brief  Interface for transmit buffer reconfiguration pseudo-messages.
*
* Certain application protocols, e.g. XCP on FlexRay, require LPDU-IDs
* to be dynamically allocated amongst the partipating nodes. Furthermore,
* typical FlexRay controller firmware supports only a limited number of
* transmit buffers. Thus, these buffers need to be reused for different
* LPDU-IDs.
*
* Sending an instance of this pseudo-message to a transmit queue will
* reconfigure the specified transmit buffer to apply to a different
* LPDU-ID.
*
* Its proccessing will be synchronized with all other messages in the
* queue: The buffer will be reconfigured after all previous messages
* got processed / sent to the bus and for all following messages, the
* new transmit buffer configuration will apply.
*
* @ref IMessage::GetID returns the same value as @ref GetTxBufferIndex.
*
* @remark All public methods except @ref ITxMessage::Destroy are thread-safe.
* @remark The OLI @ref ITxQueue "transmit queues" will never assume
*         ownership over the message instances added to them.
*         Instead, the client is responsible of destroying the
*         message instances after usage.
* @remark Pseudo-messages will not be sent to the bus but consumed by
*         the driver stack itself.
* @remark A queue will only be able to modify transmit buffers assigned to
*         that queue. Pseudo-messages pertaining to other buffers will be
*         ignored.
* @remark Please note that reconfiguring transmit buffers may cause following
*         messages in the same queue to get "stuck", i.e. never be processed
*         if no suitable (e.g. sufficiently large) active transmit buffer
*         remains. The only way to resolve that situation would be either to
*         call the @ref ITxQueue::Clear method or to close the queue entirely.
* @remark Changing the transmit buffer configuration may be unsafe in the
*         static segment.
* @coding Client applications may implement this interface.
* @since  BOA 1.3
* @see    ITxQueue, IFlexRayLink, IFlexRaySwitchMessage
*
* @todo   verify that unsuitable reconf messages get ignored.
* @todo   how are conflicts handled?
* @todo   Can we reconfigure buffers that are active?
