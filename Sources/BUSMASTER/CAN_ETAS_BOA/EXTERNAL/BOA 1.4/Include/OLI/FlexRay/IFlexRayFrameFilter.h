/** @ingroup GROUP_OLI_FLEXRAY_FILTERS
* @brief  A specialized frame filter class for FlexRay frames.
*
* In addition to the base class conditions, this interface checks
* for the @ref IFlexRayRxFrame::GetChannel "channel",
* @ref IFlexRayRxFrame::GetSlot "direction" and
* @ref IFlexRayRxFrame::GetCycleNumber "cycle offset" of the
* LPDU-ID in which the frame was received. It allows also to
* filter for the @ref IFlexRayRxFrame::GetFrameType "frame type"
* and @ref IFlexRayRxFrame::GetPayloadLength "payload length"
* (in 16-bit words).
*
* The implementation is expected to match @ref IFlexRayRxFrame
* instances only.
*
* This interface's implementation of IFilter::GetIDMask returns a value created by combining the
* @ref GetChannelMask "channel mask", @ref GetSlotMask "slot mask" and @ref GetCycleNumberMask "cycle offset mask"
* specified in IFlexRayFrameFilter::Create():
* @code
*                +------+------+----------+--------------+
* bit position   |  18  |  17  | 16 .. 6  |    5 .. 0    |
*                +------+------+----------+--------------+
* content        | ch B | ch A |   slot   | cycle offset |
*                +------+------+----------+--------------+
* @endcode
* This interface's implementation of IFilter::GetIDValue returns a similar combination of
* @ref GetChannelValue "channel value", @ref GetSlotValue "slot value" and @ref GetCycleNumberValue "cycle offset value".
*
* It is important that these two encoding schemes match the similar scheme used by the IFlexRayTxFrame implementation
* for encoding the value returned by IMessage::GetID.
*
* @remark All public methods are thread-safe.
* @coding Client applications may implement this interface.
* @since  BOA 1.3
