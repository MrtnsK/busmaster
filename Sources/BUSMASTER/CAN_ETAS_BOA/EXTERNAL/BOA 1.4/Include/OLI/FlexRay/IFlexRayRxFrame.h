/** @ingroup GROUP_OLI_FLEXRAY_MESSAGES
* @brief  Interface describing a received FlexRay frame.
*
* In addition to the base class data, this interface provides information
* on the @ref GetChannel "channel", @ref GetSlot "slot" and @ref
* GetCycleNumber "cycle number (offset)" of the LPDU-ID in which the frame was
* received. It also reports the @ref GetFrameType "frame type", a @ref
* GetHeaderCRC "CRC value" for the header as well as the @ref
* GetPayloadLength "payload length" in 16-bit words (@ref IRxFrame::GetSize
* will return twice the value).
*
* This interface's implementation of @ref IMessage::GetID returns a value created by combining the
* @ref GetChannel "channel number", @ref GetSlot "slot" and @ref GetCycleNumber "cycle number (offset)"
* of the LPDU-ID in which the frame was  received:
* @code
*                +------+------+----------+--------------+
* bit position   |  18  |  17  | 16 .. 6  |    5 .. 0    |
*                +------+------+----------+--------------+
* content        | ch B | ch A |   slot   | cycle offset |
*                +------+------+----------+--------------+
* @endcode
*
* @remark All public methods are thread-safe.
* @remark The lifetime of all objects implementing this interface
*         is defined by the @ref IRxQueue "receive queue" instance
*         that contains them. Consequently, the same applies to the
*         payload as well.
* @since  BOA 1.3
* @see    IRxQueue, IFlexRayLink
