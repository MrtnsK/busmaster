    @brief  The time in actual nanoseconds since the UNIX epoch (TAI).

    @remark TAITime measures the exact number of seconds since
            1 Jan 1970 (TAI) as defined by the TAI consortium. Like
            UTC days, TAI days are exactly 86400 seconds long. Contrary
            to @ref UTCTime, however, TAI days are not synchronized to
            Earth's rotation by means of leap seconds.

    @remark Unlike @ref UTCTime, TAITime offers a continuos time
            scale. Subtracting two TAITime stamps yields the
            actual number of seconds passed between the two events,
            as measured using the weighted average of the results
            of the atomic clocks that TAI is comprised of.

/** @brief  The time in UTC nanoseconds since the UNIX epoch.

    @remark UTCTime days are defined to be exactly 86400
            seconds long. That is, if you calculate the difference
            betwween two UTCTime values by simple subtraction,
            leap seconds will not be taken into account.
            Leap days, on the other hand, will.

    @remark The UNIX epoch is typically defined as 1 Jan 1970
            00:00 UTC. However, this is not entirely correct
            because UTC was not finalized before 1 Jan 1972.
            OLI uses the traditional solution for this problem:
            The start of the epoch is defined to be exactly two
            regular years (no leap day, no leap second) prior
            to 1 Jan 1972 UTC, that is, 1 Jan 1972 00:00 UTC is
            +63,072,000,000,000,000 in UTCTime (63.072 million
            seconds).
