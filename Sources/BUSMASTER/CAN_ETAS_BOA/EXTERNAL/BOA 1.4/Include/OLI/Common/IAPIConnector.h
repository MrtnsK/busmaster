*
*         See @ref BinaryCompatibility "binary compatibility"
*         for an explanation of why it is needed.
*
*         NOTE that clients are encouraged to access this function
*         via the wrapper @ref IAPIConnector::Create().
*
* @param[in]  link
*         The OLI link instance for which the extension API shall
*         be instantiated.
* @param[in]  usingAPI
*         A unique identifier for the using (calling) API.
*         Per extension API and @a link instance, there may be at
*         most one API connector instance.
* @param[out] ppAPIConnector
*         A pointer to an object supporting @ref IAPIConnector,
*         which has already been AddRef-ed. The object must be
*         reference-counted by the caller, using the object's
*         methods @ref IRefCountable::AddRef "AddRef()" and
*         @ref IRefCountable::Release "Release()". This is easily
*         done by wrapping the object pointer in an instance of the
*         @ref AutoPtr class, which will be done automatically if
*         the caller accesses @ref IAPIConnector_Create()
*         via the wrapper @ref IAPIConnector::Create().
*
* @return A pointer to an interface based on @ref IError, describing
*         the error which occurred during this function. @c NULL if
*         no error occurred. See @ref ErrorReporting "error reporting"
*         for more information on how errors are reported.
*
* @exception <none> This function must not throw exceptions.

* @brief  Managed access to an existing link's OCI-level information.
*
* The core OLI supports only a pre-defined set of bus-specific APIs.
* Additional functionality can be made available through hard- and
* firmware-specific extension APIs. They augment existing links to
* the target with an additional set of functions.
*
* Prior to creating a instance of the extension API on the OLI level,
* an instance on the next lower level, the OCI, must be established.
* To do that, OLL-internal information is required that can be
* retrieved through this interace. It also keeps the underlying
* OLI and OCI core connections valid for as long as they are used
* by the extension API.
*
* An API can be available only once per link. Therefore, for any
* @ref ILink "link" - @ref BOA_UuidBin "API ID" combination, there
* can be at most one @a IAPIConnector instance. Any attempt to create
* more instances will result in exceptions being thrown.
*
* @remark All public methods are thread-safe.
* @coding This interface is intended for usage among "peer DLLs"
*         implementing extension APIs on the same abstraction level
*         as the OLI. Client applications should not instantiate
*         this interface.
* @since  BOA 1.3
