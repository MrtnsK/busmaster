/** @ingroup GROUP_OLI_COMMON_FILTERS
* @brief  Auxilliary interface for efficient message filtering.
*
* The information provided through this interface can be
* used by the OLL-internal filter mechanisms to pre-filter
* most imcoming data. If the client application has a high
* filter ratio, i.e. any received message gets added to only
* very few of many active queues, the pre-filtering will
* drastically improve performance.
*
* To allow that, this interface describes static filter properties.
* The most basic information a message carries is its
* @ref IMessage::GetType "type" and @ref IMessage::GetID "ID".
* Since @ref IFilter already tests for the ID, we add only
* the @ref GetTypeMask "type filter" here. Their combination
* will already allow for a highly selective pre-filtering.
*
* To make this work, all information returned by this interface
* plus the @ref IFilter::GetIDMask and @ref IFilter::GetIDValue
* methods must return values that will not change over the
* filter's life-time.
*
* User-defined filter classes will generally need to apply
* additional conditions. In that case, @ref RequiresPostFiltering
* must return @a true. Otherwise, messages passing the pre-filter
* will be put into the queue with no further filtering - bypassing
* the filter object entierly.
*
* All filter classes shipped with OLI support this interface.
* User-defined filters should do this interface as well.
*
* @remark All public methods are thread-safe.
* @remark An object implementing this interface must remain valid
*         as long as the @ref IFilter instance returning it through
*         @ref IFilter::GetQuickFilterSupport remains valid.
* @coding Client applications may implement this interface.
* @since  BOA 1.3
* @see    @ref filterConcepts "Filter concepts", IFilter, IRxMessage
