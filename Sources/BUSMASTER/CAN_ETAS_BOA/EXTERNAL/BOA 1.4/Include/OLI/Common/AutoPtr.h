/** @ingroup GROUP_OLI_COMMON_BASE
* @brief  Utility class template for automatic reference counting.
*
* This template class uses the RAII pattern to satisfy the constraints
* of reference counting OLI objects. All interfaces deriving from
* @ref IRefCountable should be accessed only through pointers wrapped
* by AutoPtr<>.
*
* Typical pointer operators (assigment, dereferencing, conversion
* to boolean) are being provided. However, there is not comparison
* operator, particularly for @c NULL. Use the @ref get() method
* to compare two pointers. Also, calling the @ref reset method is
* more efficient than assigning NULL.
*
* Since @a operator& has not been overloaded, AutoPtr<> objects are
* compatbile with STL containers.
*
* AutoPtr<> objects are not meant to be shared between threads.
* Every thread should have its own reference to the underlying
* object. To allow duplication of AutoPtr<> among differnt threads,
* copy construction, assigment and destruction have been made
* thread-safe.
*
* @param  I  Type of the wrapped interface pointer. Must be derived
*            from @ref IRefCountable.
*
* @remark Only construction, destruction and assignment are thread-safe.
* @remark This is client-application-side code. Depending on the
*         compiler used for the client application, some features
*         may not be available.
* @coding This class is considered "final". Do not inherit from it.
