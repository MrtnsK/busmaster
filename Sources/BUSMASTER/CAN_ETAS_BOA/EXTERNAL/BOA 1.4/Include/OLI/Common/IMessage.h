/**
* @ingroup GROUP_OLI_COMMON_MESSAGES
* @brief Base interface for all frames and events.
*
* The common abstraction is that every message has a
* @ref GetType "type" and an @ref GetID "ID". Together,
* they specify how the message content is to be interpreted.
*
* The type denotes the C++ class, i.e. equals the @a TYPE
* member of the respective interface. Received CAN frames,
* for example, will return @ref ICANRxFrame::TYPE.
* OLI has been designed to allow for static casts based
* on that information:
*
* @code
* void OLI_CALL CMyObserver::Trigger (IRxQueue* queue) OLI_NOTHROW
* {
*     const IRxMessage* message = queue->GetOldest();
*     if (message->GetType() == ICANRxFrame::TYPE)
*     {
*         const ICANRxFrame* frame = static_cast<const ICANRxFrame*>(message);
*         std::cout << "recieved " << frame->GetSize() << " payload bytes\n";
*     }
*     queue->Pop();
* }
* @endcode
*
* The @ref GetID "ID" property is best understood in the case of data frames: here it is usually the frame ID
* in some bus-specific encoding. However @em any subclass of IMessage must implement the @ref IMessage::GetID
* method, even subclasses such as IQueueEvent which may not seem to have a property which can be interpreted as
* an "ID". Please refer to the documentation of the various subclasses of IMessage for information about how
* each implements @ref IMessage::GetID.
*
* @remark All public methods are thread-safe.
* @remark Receive messages are owned by the receiving queue.
*         Send messages are owned by the client application.
*         Hence, there is no need for reference counting.
* @since  BOA 1.3
* @see    IQueue, IFilter
