/** @page filterConcepts Filter Concepts
*
* The OLI uses a white filter approach. Per default, no data
* will pass and at least one matching filter must be found
* to make the respective message pass.
*
* All standard filter implementations provided with OLI
* are stateless: Each filter is usually a combination of
* conditions on the message data wich must all be met,
* e.g. one condition on the frame ID and one on the
* frame content.
*
* Every condition follows the same basic pattern:
* @code
* message.VALUE & filter.MASK == filter.VALUE
* @endcode
*
* To let all frames pass through a filter set all conditions to
* @code
* filter.MASK = 0
* filter.VALUE = 0
* @endcode
*
* To filter for an exact match use
* @code
* MASK = 0xffffffff
* VALUE = required value.
* @endcode
*
* To filter a subset of flags in a bitfield, i.e. to
* block all if any @em other flag is set, use
* @code
* MASK = ~(PASSED_FLAG_A|PASSED_FLAG_B|PASSED_FLAG_C)
* VALUE = 0
* @endcode

/** @ingroup GROUP_OLI_COMMON_FILTERS
* @brief  Base interface for all @ref IRxMessage "message" filters.
*
* This base interface is implemented by any object which is able to filter instances of @ref IRxMessage, usually
* in order to decide whether such an instance should be  added to a @ref IRxQueue "receive queue".
* An object implementing @ref IFilter encapsulates a criterion which it applies to the  @ref IMessage::GetID "ID"
* of any instance of @ref IRxMessage. The criterion takes the form of a (mask, value) pair, as described in
* @ref filterConcepts "Filter concepts". During the method @ref IFilter::Matches(), the implementation must apply
* the criterion to the supplied instance of @ref IRxMessage.
*
* The documentation for IMessage discusses how, in some cases, an object which implements a subclass of IMessage
* may not have a property which can easily be interpreted as an "ID". As a result, the various subclasses of
* IMessage implement @ref IMessage::GetID in various ways. This also affects the corresponding subclasses of
* IFilter. For example, if IQueueEvent implements IMessage::GetID by returning an event code, users of
* IQueueEventFilter must supply an event code mask and value when they construct an instance of IQueueEventFilter,
* and IQueueEventFilter's implementation of IFilter::GetIDMask and IFilter::GetIDValue will return that event code
* mask and value. Please refer to the documentation of the various subclasses of IFilter for information about how
* each implements IFilter::GetIDMask and IFilter::GetIDValue.
*
* Clearly it may be necessary to construct a filter which tests more than the @ref IMessage::GetID "ID" of an
* instance of @ref IRxMessage. An interface derived from @ref IFilter can add other filter criteria specific to
* a particular subclass of @ref IRxMessage. Then, during the method @ref IFilter::Matches(), the derived filter
* can use type-specific criteria (plus run-time typing), as well as the "ID" criterion described above, to filter
* the supplied instance of @ref IRxMessage.
*
* Although the OLI ships with a number of pre-defined implementations of interfaces derived from IFilter, client
* applications are free to implement IFilter themselves, and perhaps to define their own derived filter interfaces.
* Nevertheless, IFilter is the only interface which a client @em must implement to make their filters work within
* the OLI.
*
* Messages will only be added to the receive queue, if at least
* one of the filters @ref IRxQueue::AddFilter "added" to that
* queue @ref Matches "matches". Because the order in which filters
* get probed is undefined, there is no guarantee that the
* @ref Matches method of any particular filter instance gets
* called.
*
* Any kind of stateless or stateful filter implementation is allowed.
* For maximum efficiency, filters should also support
* @ref IQuickFilterSupport "quick filtering". Return a pointer to
* that interface in you implementation of @ref GetQuickFilterSupport.
*
* @remark All public methods are thread-safe.
* @coding Client applications may implement this interface.
* @since  BOA 1.3
