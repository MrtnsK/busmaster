/**
* @ingroup GROUP_OLI_COMMON_QUEUES
* @brief Base interface for all queues.
*
* The interface provides an abstract notion of @ref IMessage
* "message" queue with a fill level. Access to the messages
* will be offered in derived interfaces and will be different
* for @ref IRxQueue "rx" and @ref ITxQueue "tx queues".
*
* Also, queues may be (de-)activated. Only when activated,
* will they send or receive data, respectively. Data coming
* from the controller will be lost for de-acticated receive
* queues. To actually exchange messages with the OCI,
* the queue and respective link has to be active. (see @ref
* ILink::IsActive) If not specified otherwise for a particular
* link type, queues are active per default.
*
* @remark All public methods are thread-safe.
* @coding Client applications are not meant to implement
*         this interface.
* @since  BOA 1.3
* @see    IRxQueue, ITxQueue, ILink::IsActive
