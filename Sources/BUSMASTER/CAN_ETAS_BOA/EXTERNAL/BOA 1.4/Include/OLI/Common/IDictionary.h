* @brief  Base interface that represents a read-only container of
*         key/value entries.
*
*         The information is based on some OCI level data dictionary.
*         Specialized interfaces will extend it with support for
*         modification and other features.
*
*         Objects providing this interface are expected to be unique
*         members of a link object providing @ref ILink. Thus, it has
*         an (indirect) connection to the virtual controller instance.
*
* @remark All public methods are thread-safe.
* @remark Objects implementing this interface are gurateed to live as
*         long as the @ref ILink instance that returned them.
