/**
* @file
* @brief  Proxy classes for @ref IError objects.
*
*         This file declares proxy classes, each of which wraps a
*         heap-allocated error object created by the OLL to encapsulate
*         information about an error which has occurred. Each proxy class
*         is instantiated by the client and uses the "pimpl" design pattern
*         to delegate to the wrapped error object.
*
*         The existence of the proxy classes gives the client application
*         of the OLL two advantages:
*           - The client can throw an instance of a proxy object, thereby
*             using exception syntax to handle the associated error.
*           - Each proxy object automatically ensures that the corresponding
*             heap-allocated error object is correctly deleted.
*
* @remark The header structure of the OLI may change
*         in future releases. Don't include this
*         header directly. Use @ref OLI.h instead.

/** @ingroup GROUP_OLI_COMMON_ERROR
 * @brief  Base class of all OLI exception classes.
 *
 * The hierarchy of proxy classes matches the hierarchy of error interfaces,
 * which is based on @ref IError. This is done to allow the client to handle
 * proxies (and thereby errors) in type-specific or type-independent ways as
 * required. Each error proxy class wraps a corresponding interface derived
 * from @ref IError.
 *
 * @a CError objects are suitable for being thrown and caught as exceptions.
 * They automatically manage the lifetime of the wrapped @ref IError instance.
 *
 * An error object created by the OLL will always occupy a leaf position in
 * the hierarchy of error objects, and must always implement an error
 * interface which occupies a leaf position in the hierarchy of error
 * interfaces. For example, an error object can never "really" be of a type
 * like @c COLIErrorImpl, implementing @ref IOLIError; it must in fact have
 * a derived type such as @c CInvalidStateErrorImpl, implementing
 * @ref IInvalidStateError.
 *
 * However, no such restriction exists for proxy classes. For example,
 * the class @ref CError can be instantiated and used as a proxy to any type
 * of error object; the class @ref COLIError can be instantiated and used as
 * a proxy to any error object which implements @ref IOLIError. In this sense,
 * the proxy classes are like pointers: a pointer (or proxy object) can have
 * a different type from the error object to which it refers.
 *
 * In practice, the most specific error class will be instantiated by
 * @ref CheckAndThrow. That is, for every interface in the @ref IError
 * hierarchy, a suitable counterpart derived from @a CError exists. Only if
 * a future BOA implementation introduces additional error interfaces,
 * @a CheckAndThrow will fall back to the base class proxies in old client
 * applications.
 *
 * @remark Prefer using @a CError (or derived) objects over plain @ref IError
 *         instances.
 * @remark Instances of this class and its sub-classes are intended to be
 *         thrown as excepions.
 * @remark This class is not intended for derivation as its implementation
 *         details may change in future BOA versions. If you still derive
 *         from it, you may need to adapt or rewrite that code for newer
 *         versions of the API.

/** @ingroup GROUP_OLI_COMMON_ERROR
 * @brief  Converts OLI error objects into client-side exceptions.
 *
 * This helper function is intended to be called by an inline wrapper
 * method defined in an OLI interface class. NOTE that @a  CheckAndThrow()
 * must be compiled by the client.
 *
 * When an OLI method fails, it returns a pointer to an object which
 * implements an interface derived from IError. The OLI method is wrapped
 * by an inline wrapper method, defined in the same interface, which passes
 * the @ref IError pointer to @a CheckAndThrow(). @a CheckAndThrow() will
 * discover the derived type of the error interface, then construct an
 * appropriately-typed proxy for the derived error interface.
 *
 * For example, if the @ref IError interface's derived type is actually
 * @ref IInvalidStateError, @a CheckAndThrow() constructs an instance of
 * @ref CInvalidStateError as a proxy for @a IInvalidStateError.
 *
 * @a CheckAndThrow throws the proxy object which it constructs. The proxy
 * class, or one of its base classes, can be caught by the client. See the
 * examples in @ref ErrorReporting "error reporting" for more details.
 *
 * @param[in] pError  A pointer to an OLI error object.
 * @exception CError  This function must not throw exceptions.
 *
 * @remark To prevent this function from being inlined, define the
 *         @ref OLI_DONT_INLINE_CHECKANDTHROW.
 *
 * @since  BOA 1.3
 * @see    @ref ErrorReporting "error reporting", IError, CError,
 *         OLI_DONT_INLINE_CHECKANDTHROW
