/**
 * @page ErrorReporting Error Reporting
 *
 * The strategy used to report errors from the OLL to its clients aims
 * to meet these requirements:
 *  - Errors must be reported in a way which does not break binary
 *    compatibility (see @ref BinaryCompatibility "there" ).
 *  - A client of the OLL must be able to use exception syntax to handle
 *    errors reported by OLI methods.
 *  - There must be minimal impact on performance unless an error is
 *    actually reported.
 *  - It must be possible for the OLL to report additional information
 *    beyond a description of the type of error which has occurred.
 *
 * Internally, the OLL uses exceptions to handle errors. In order to satisfy
 * the above requirements, the methods of the OLI report errors as follows:
 *
 *  - Each exception which is raised within the OLL is caught before it
 *    leaves the OLL and is used to construct an error object of a
 *    corresponding type, such as @c COCIErrorImpl, @c CNotSupportedErrorImpl,
 *    and do on. Each error object implements an interface derived from
 *    @c IError, such as @c IOCIError, @c INotSupportedError, etc.
 *    Each error object is constructed on the heap.
 *
 *  - When an OLI method needs to report an error, it returns a pointer to
 *    @c IError, as implemented by the object which was constructed on the
 *    heap to represent the error.
 *
 *  - Each OLI method which can report an error is wrapped by an inline
 *    non-virtual wrapper method, defined in the same interface as the
 *    method which it wraps. When the wrapped method returns a pointer
 *    to @c IError, the wrapper method passes the pointer to the helper
 *    function @ref CheckAndThrow(). This helper function must be compiled
 *    as part of the client. The inline wrapper method will also be
 *    automatically compiled as part of the client: see
 *    @ref BinaryCompatibility "binary compatibility".
 *
 *  - When a pointer to @c IError is passed to @ref CheckAndThrow(),
 *    the function discovers the derived type of the error interface,
 *    then constructs an appropriately-typed proxy for the derived error
 *    interface. For example, if the @c IError interface's derived type
 *    is actually @c IInvalidStateError, CheckAndThrow() constructs an
 *    instance of @c CInvalidStateError as a proxy for @c IInvalidStateError.
 *
 *  - The proxy which is constructed by @ref CheckAndThrow() delegates
 *    to the original error interface via the "pimpl" design pattern.
 *    The proxy's destructor destroys the original error object via
 *    @c IError::Destroy(). An instance of a proxy class cannot be copied
 *    or assigned to.
 *
 *  - Once CheckAndThrow() has constructed an appropriately-typed proxy,
 *    it throws it. This allows the client to handle OLI errors by catching
 *    (by reference) instances of the proxies constructed by CheckAndThrow().
 *
 * The following example may help to make this process clearer. It shows
 * how the @c GetStatus() method would be implemented on the interface
 * @c ISomething:
 * @code
 *
 *  // OLI method definition, within Something.cpp in the OLL library.
 *  IError* CSomething::GetStatus( int* pStatus )
 *  {
 *      try
 *      {
 *          // Calculate status
 *          ...
 *          *pStatus = ...;
 *      }
 *      catch( OCIException& ociException )
 *      {
 *          // The OCI reported an error.
 *          return new COCIErrorImpl( ociException );
 *      }
 *      catch( InvalidStateException& invalidStateException )
 *      {
 *          // It is not valid to call this method at the moment.
 *          return new CInvalidStateErrorImpl( invalidStateException );
 *      }
 *      // Other catch() clauses as needed
 *      ...
 *      catch(...)
 *      {
 *          // Something unexpected went wrong.
 *          return new CUnexpectedErrorImpl();
 *      }
 *
 *      // Success
 *      return NULL;
 *  }
 *
 *  // Interface declaration, within public OLI file ISomething.h
 *  ISomething
 *  {
 *  protected:
 *      // This is the "real" API method.
 *      virtual IError* GetStatus( int* pStatus ) = 0;
 *
 *  public:
 *      // This wrapper will be compiled inline by the client.
 *      // It fulfils two purposes:
 *      //  - It uses CheckAndThrow() to convert any error into an exception.
 *      //  - It converts the method's signature so that client can access the
 *      //    result via the return value, instead of via an output parameter.
 *      int GetStatus()
 *      {
 *          int status = 0;
 *          CheckAndThrow( GetStatus( &status ) );
 *          return status;
 *      };
 *  };
 *
 *  // Usage, within client file MyOLIClient.cpp
 *  {
 *      try
 *      {
 *          AutoPtr< ISomething > pSomething = ...;
 *
 *          int status = pSomething->GetStatus();
 *      }
 *      catch( COCIError& ociError )    // Note we must catch by reference: COCIError cannot be copied.
 *      {
 *          // We have caught a derived error proxy, representing a specific
 *          // error. We can access the properties of ociError to discover
 *          // more details.
 *          printf( "The OLL encountered an OCI error with code 0x%08x and message \"%s\"\n",
 *                  ociError.GetCode(), ociError.GetMessage() );
 *      }
 *      catch( CError& error )          // Note we must catch by reference: CError cannot be copied.
 *      {
 *          // We have caught a base error proxy, which we must can handle
 *          // in a type-independent way.
 *          printf( "The OLL has encountered an error of type 0x%08x with message \"%s\"\n",
 *                  error.GetMostDerivedType(), error.GetMessage() );
 *      }
 *  }
 * @endcode
 *
 * Note that in this example, the public and protected implementations
 * of @c GetStatus() have different argument lists and therefore can have
 * the same name. In some cases, both the public wrapper and the protected
 * API method have the same argument list; when this occurs, the protected
 * API method is given the suffix "...Raw".
 *
 * There is one problem with the solution described above: what happens
 * if the OLL must call an OLI method internally? In the language of the
 * example above, what happens if the OLL must call @c ISomething::GetStatus
 * internally?
 *
 * In such a situation, the caller (i.e. the OLL) wishes to allow an
 * exception which is thrown within the OLI method to propagate to the
 * caller. Such an exception will eventually be caught elsewhere in the
 * OLL and returned to the OLI client as an error object, as described above.
 *
 * The solution is to define an OLL-internal "throwing" variant of the
 * method in question. In the above example, this method would be called
 * @c CSomething::GetStatusThrowing(). @c GetStatus() would delegate to
 * @c GetStatusThrowing(), which would perform the work of the method and,
 * perhaps, throw an exception. If the OLL needed to call @c GetStatus()
 * internally, it would call @c GetStatusThrowing().
