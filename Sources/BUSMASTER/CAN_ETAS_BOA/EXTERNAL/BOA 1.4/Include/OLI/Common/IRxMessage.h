/**

* @brief Base interface for all received messages.
*
* Extends the base interface by adding a receive time stamp.
* Up to three different time scales are available. The @ref
* GetRawTimeStamp "raw" format is the original value that
* had been attached to the message at the source. Its
* interpretation depends on the respective link's @ref
* ILink::GetTimer "timer".
*
* If available, the OLI will interpret that information for
* your convenience and convert the raw time stamp into @ref
* GetTAITimeStamp "TAI" and @ref GetUTCTimeStamp "UTC" time
* stamps. The latter is only possible if the necessary information
* has been provided through @ref ITimer::LoadLeapSecondDataFile.
*
* @remark All public methods are thread-safe.
* @remark The lifetime of all objects implementing this interface
*         is defined by the @ref IRxQueue "receive queue" instance
*         that contains them.
* @since  BOA 1.3
