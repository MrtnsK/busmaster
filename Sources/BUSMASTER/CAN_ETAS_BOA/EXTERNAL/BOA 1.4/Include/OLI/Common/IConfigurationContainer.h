/** Represents the controller configuration as a flat list of
* @ref IConfigurationParameter instances.
*
* Objects providing this interface are expected to be unique
* members of a link object providing @ref ILink. Thus, it has
* an (indirect) connection to the actual controller and cannot
* be instantiated by OLI users.
*
* The class implementing @ref IConfigurationContainer is also
* expected to store the parameter definitions (OCI data dictionary)
* values in some internal structure. Initially, this structure
* is empty and must be filled by calling @ref Read. Once the
* user completed the configuration, it will be applied automatically
* when the respective link is activated (see \ref ILink::SetActive).
*
* Virtual parameters (like file names) are allowed. Use observers
* (see @ref IConfigurationObserver) to ensure consistency and to
* map virtual parameters onto 'real' ones. Observers are called
* nestedly (if they modify other parameters) and in the same
* sequence they have been added.
*
* If modifying a parameter value fails with a (possibly
* indirect) exception, the chang(es) must be undone automatically
* and no further notifications must be sent. This includes
* nested changes that have completed successfully.
