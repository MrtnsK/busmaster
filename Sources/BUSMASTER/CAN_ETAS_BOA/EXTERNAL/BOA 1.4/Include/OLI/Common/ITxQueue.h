* @brief Base interface for all transmit messages.
*
* In contrast to @ref IRxMessage "receive messages", these messages are
* being created on behalf of the client application. Therefore, the
* lifetime of the instances must be controlled by the client application:
* To delete transmit messages created by some OLI factory called by the
* client, that client must call the @ref Destroy method once the message
* object is no longer needed.
*
* @remark All public methods are thread-safe.
* @coding Client applications may implement this interface.
* @since  BOA 1.3
