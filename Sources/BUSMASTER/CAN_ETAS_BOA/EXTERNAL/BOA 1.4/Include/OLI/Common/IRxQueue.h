* \brief Receive queue
*
* It extends the base interface by a method
* to extract the oldest message from the queue.
*
* The messages that will be received must match at least one
* filter condition. So, to receive any data, at least one
* filter must be registered.
*
* If multiple rx queues have been created for a link, they *all*
* first receive the data. Only after the last queue got filled,
* will the respective observers be triggered. Otherwise event
* queue listeners could get out of sync with queues receiving
* the same events in-band.
