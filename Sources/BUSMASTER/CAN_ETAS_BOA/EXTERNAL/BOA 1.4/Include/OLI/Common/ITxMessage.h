* To delete transmit messages created by some OLI factory called by the
* client, that client must call the @ref Destroy method once the message
* object is no longer needed.
*
* @remark All public methods except @ref Destroy are thread-safe.

        this interface has not been implemented by the client application.

        @exception <none> This function must not throw exceptions.

        @remark This method may not be thread-safe in the sense that
                it is not reentrant and will not synchronize with any
                calls to other methods in this interface. For most
                applications, this is not an issue as their logic needs
                to coordinate when an object becomes invalidated.
        @remark Avoid calling @a Destroy manually.
                Use the @ref AutoDestroyPtr wrapper template instead.
