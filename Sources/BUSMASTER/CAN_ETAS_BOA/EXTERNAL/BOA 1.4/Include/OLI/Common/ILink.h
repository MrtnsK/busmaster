* The link exposes zero or more read and write queues. Since their
* creation may require bus-specific parameters, CreateRxQueue
* and CreateTxQueue cannot be declared in this base interface.
* Also, the number of queues that may be created depends on the

* Every link contains a mutex variable that must be used to
* synchronize access to the link itself and all dependent objects.
