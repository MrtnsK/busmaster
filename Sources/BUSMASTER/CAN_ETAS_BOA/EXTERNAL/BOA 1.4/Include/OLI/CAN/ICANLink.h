 * This function instantiates an object supporting ICANLink. See \ref BinaryCompatibility for an explanation of why it is needed.

 *
 * \param[in]  URI       The URI identifying the instance which is to be created.
 * \param[out] ppCanLink The new instance of CCANLink; the function addrefs this instance before handing it out. The object must
 *                       be reference-counted by the caller, using the object's methods AddRef() and Release(). This is easily
 *                       done by wrapping the object pointer in an instance of the AutoPtr class, which will be done automatically
 *                       if the caller accesses ICANLink_Create() via the wrapper ICANLink::Create().
 * \param[in]  version   The OLI version which the client expects to use.
 *
 * \return A pointer to an interface based on IError, describing the error which occurred during this function. NULL if no error
 * occurred. See \ref ErrorReporting for more information on how errors are reported.
