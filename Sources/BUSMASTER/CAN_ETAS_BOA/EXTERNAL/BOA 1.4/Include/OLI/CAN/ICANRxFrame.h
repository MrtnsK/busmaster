                @ref IRxFrame::GetSize.

                However, the CAN specification implicitly permits DLC values which are > 8 and <= 15, though in such a
                case the frame will still contain only 8 data bytes. Consequently, some CAN controllers are able to
                receive a frame with DLC > 8 (though such a frame still only contains 8 data bytes); the OLI API will
                process such a frame as follows:
                    - @ref ICANRxFrame::GetDLC will return the frame's DLC (> 8);

                    - @ref IRxFrame::GetSize will return the number of bytes in the frame's payload (= 8);
