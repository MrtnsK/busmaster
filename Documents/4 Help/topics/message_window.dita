        <li>Message transmitted across the CAN bus, including the one generated by BUSMASTER.</li>
        <li>Error messages</li>
      </ul></p>
    <p>Each message is displayed in a separate line, which consists of the following five fields listed below respectively<ul>
        <li>Time – Time can be viewed in three different modes, namely<ul>
            <li>System – In this mode, message will be displayed with PC/System time.</li>
            <li>Relative – In this mode, message will be displayed with time since the reception of the message with same identifier previously.</li>
            <li>Absolute – In this mode, the reference is the time of connection. Messages will be displayed with time since the logical connection with the device(ES581) is established.</li>
          </ul></li>
      </ul></p>
    <p>In all cases time format is maintained as HH: MM: SS: MS where MS stands for millisecond, and the display will be in 24-hour scale.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Tx/Rx - A message transmitted from BUSMASTER is tagged as Tx whereas for a received one the tag is Rx.</li>

          <li>Xr – Extended RTR frame</li>
        </ul></li>
      <li>Message - This section contains the message ID. However, BUSMASTER enables to attribute a message with a specified name and color. If a particular message code is attributed with a name and a color, message name will appear in place of message ID and the message will be displayed in the specified color.</li>
      <li>DLC – It is abbreviation for data length count. It shows number of data bytes in the message body.</li>
      <li>Data Byte(s) – The data bytes are displayed either in hexadecimal or in decimal mode. Please refer to section Toggle numeric mode to know how to toggle numeric modes. On occurrence of an error a suitable error message will be displayed in red color</li>
