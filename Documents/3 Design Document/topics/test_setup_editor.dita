    <p>This helper module basically manipulates entities of varying kinds. For example â€“ a test case node contains four different kinds of sub entities or nodes. Also, sub entities like send or verify also contain their own message sub-entities whereas nodes like wait, replay are simple nodes. Nevertheless, all of them must exhibit functionalities like addition, deletion, modification of self. Also, repositioning of a sub entity is also a desired functionality. Therefore, it is the obvious decision to inherit them from a common base class named as CBaseEntityTA (TA stands for Test Automation). Also, each of the objects has a data part. The overall class structure may be expressed by the following class design diagram where the Test Setup Editor Lib is realised by the class CTestSetupEntity<image placement="break" href="../images/umls/test_setup_editor.png"/></p>
